CHANGELOG
=========

v0.4.0
======

* **New:** Some PEP8 and Python 3+ updates.

* **New:** Added *unittests* for the whole library (requires python 2.7+).

* **Update:** The ``format`` parameter is renamed to ``fmt`` in
  ``uncompress()`` and ``Sequence.format()`` to not to shadow the 
  **Python built-in**.

* **New:** Added a method called ``includes()`` to the ``Sequence`` class
  that does what the ``contains()`` method was doing in previous versions, 
  that is, it now checks if the given Item could be contained in that 
  particular Sequence.

* **Update:** Updated ``Sequence.contains()`` method behavior updated to
  better match its name, that is, it now checks if the Item is contained inside 
  the boundaries of the Sequence.

* **Fix:** The padding characters are now properly interpreted, as shown
  below::

    seq = Sequence([
        'file.0001.jpg',
        'file.0002.jpg',
        'file.0003.jpg',
        'file.0006.jpg'
    ])

    print(seq.format('%h%04s-%04e%t'))
    # will print 'file.0001-0006.jpg'

    print(seq.format('%h%4s-%4e%t'))
    # will print 'file.   1-   6.jpg'
